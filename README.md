Assalamo alaikum....


Here I gonna show you how to use HOC(Higher Order Component) to make a private route in Next JS.

But you can use this also in React.

# Steps

1. I used a js file where I have written some functions which will help us to get, set, delete, delete all the cookies in browser cookies.

2. I made a HOC function to authenticate any component which will be in private route.

3. A home page with basic design, we will see. From there We can go to dashboard is user signed in.

4. A navbar will be used to navigate Dashboard page, hompage, login page or logout.

Here is the repository link:
